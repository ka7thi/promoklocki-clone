# promoklocki-clone

I want to remind HTML, CSS stuff and learn something new - SCSS, so I decided to clone view from [www.promoklocki.pl](https://promoklocki.pl/okazje-lego). Its also first "bigger" project when I am using GIT. I am using mobile first design, so desktop version is not available yet.

I know, code and texts in commits are not perfect, but next projects will be much better. Learning in progress! :)
